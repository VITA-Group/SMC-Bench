SMC-Bench contains 4 task: Commonsense Reasoning, Arithmetic Reasoning, Multilingual Translation, and Protein Prediction. 

# Commonsense Reasoning and Multilingual Translation 

Commonsense Reasoning and Multilingual Translation are highly relied on the implementation of [Fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) provied by Facebook.

## Requirements and Installationï¼š

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.5.0
* Python version >= 3.6
* **To install fairseq** and develop locally:

``` bash

# Arithmatic Reasoning 

Arithmetic Reasoning is implemented based on the
